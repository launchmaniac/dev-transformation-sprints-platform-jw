# The Framework to Life – Core Business Overview

**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Status:** Discovery Phase (EPIC 1)

---

## Our Core Mission

Helping people become the version of themselves they know they can be through real, actionable things they can do every day.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

Most personal development fails at implementation. People read books, take courses, and understand what they should do but struggle to actually create a framework to apply it in everyday life.

---

## The Solution: Transformation Delivery System

We take research-backed frameworks (like Gottman's 40+ years of relationship science) and break them into daily actions, making real behavior changes accessible and sustainable.

---

## The Technology Engine - GHL Automation Platform

- Automated daily SMS/email delivery
- Progress tracking & user analytics
- Client segmentation & journey management
- Payment processing & billing
- Calendar integration for live sessions

---

## The Delivery System

- Clean platform for sprint content
- Email/text for reminders & nudges only
- Live Q&A sessions for connection (no community management)
- Designed for 1-to-many scale with personal feel

---

## Business Model - Mission-First Approach

**Free:** Maximum impact - full frameworks for everyone

**Premium:** Sustainability - group coaching & AI personalization

**Natural upgrade path** for those wanting deeper support

Clean, scalable, and mission-aligned.

---

## Scalable Impact

- One-to-many delivery allows helping thousands simultaneously
- Automation reduces operational overhead
- Premium services fund free access for those who can't pay

---

## Current Status and Immediate Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Validation (Next 30 Days)
- Build 30-Day Sprint in GHL (topic TBD - see EPIC 1)
- Set up email-only delivery (fastest to test)
- Create basic engagement tracking
- Recruit 30 test users to validate completion rates
- Core question: Will people actually finish 30 days?

### Phase 2: Platform Refinement (If MVP Validates)
- Add PDF and text delivery options
- Develop basic progress insights
- Build group coaching system ($47-97/month)
- Create one additional sprint based on user demand

### Phase 3: Sustainable Growth
- Begin targeted user acquisition
- Expand sprint library based on usage data
- Enhance AI personalization features
- Build team as revenue supports operations

---

## How We're Different

**We solve the last-mile problem in personal growth.**

- Others give you the map; we walk you there daily
- We curate proven frameworks rather than invent new theories
- We scale personalization through AI instead of manual labor
- We remove friction: no apps, no passwords, no overwhelm

---

## The Gap We Fill

The space between knowing (books, courses) and doing (expensive coaching).

We provide the daily implementation system that is accessible to everyone.

## MVP Validation Plan

### 1. Define the MVP
- 30-Day Sprint (topic TBD in EPIC 1)
- Email-only delivery (simplest implementation)
- Basic progress tracking
- No premium features initially

### 2. Build MVP Technical Scope
- GHL automation for daily emails
- Simple reflection tracking via email replies
- Basic analytics on open and engagement rates
- Manual cohort management initially

### 3. Find 30 Testers
- Personal network (friends, family, colleagues)
- Local groups related to sprint topic
- Previous clients
- Offer free access in exchange for detailed feedback

### 4. Gather Insights
- Track daily engagement rates
- Weekly feedback surveys
- End-of-sprint comprehensive survey
- Monitor drop-off points in the 30-day journey

### 5. Analyze Results
- Primary metric: Completion rate (target 25% or higher)
- Secondary metric: Daily engagement (target 60% or higher open rate)
- Qualitative: User feedback on content and delivery

### 6. Refine Model
- If successful: Build out additional delivery methods and sprints
- If struggling: Pivot to shorter format or adjust approach
- Use data to inform premium feature development

## Current Thinking (Discovery Phase)

**Key Question:** Where do we start to meet people where they are?

**Option A: Finding Purpose/Direction**
- Addresses: Depression epidemic, lack of direction
- Broader audience
- Harder to measure success
- May be too vague for MVP

**Option B: Specific Problem (e.g., Parenting)**
- Addresses: "I'm failing at this specific thing"
- Narrower audience
- Easier to measure success (specific behaviors)
- Proven demand

**Current Status:** Working through EPIC 1 to make this decision based on validation, not assumption.
